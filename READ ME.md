# MusicInventory

MusicInventory is a Java application for managing the inventory of a record/CD store.

## Usage

- Add and remove items to your inventory using the "add" and "remove" buttons at top.
- Edit artist/title/quantity/price data using the "edit" button.
- Click "Save Database" before exiting to save any changes made to your inventory.
